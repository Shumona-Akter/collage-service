                                <p className="py-6">To guide the students in selecting the best quality of education tailored to their merit, course timeline, and financial abilities, our dedicated advisors start with background research and Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) eligibility as a process of application.

At PFEC Global, we believe every student profile is unique, thus, focusing on evaluating each profile with time and care, considering past education qualifications and job experience through recognition of prior learning (RPL). Indeed, the extensive research on individual applicants leads us to choose what form of education will best fit their interests and prepare the supporting documents. For instance, a student with a study break of more than two years after completing High School or a Bachelorâ€™s degree must provide sufficient evidence explaining the reason for the gap. Again, each applicant must present firm grounds on the statement of purpose behind selecting a course that would significantly increase employment upon return to the home country. Fortunately, we are here to guide the students in this regard. Eventually, after evaluating interests, academic history, financial status, and future career goals our team of devoted counselors recommends the right course and institution to the students.</p>
